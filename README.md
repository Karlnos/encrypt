# GitHub README for Fake Messaging App with Secret "Password"

## Introduction

Welcome to the Fake Messaging App repository! This playful example demonstrates a fake messaging app with a secret "password" feature. When you type the specific password, it will lead you to a hidden web page—a text encryptor and decryptor. 

## Fake Messaging App

### Description

The "Fake Messaging App" is a web page designed to mimic a messaging app's user interface. It includes a chat area, message input field, and JavaScript functionality to send and display messages. Additionally, there's a hidden secret feature accessible via a specific password.

### Code Structure

- **HTML:** The HTML file defines the structure of the messaging app interface, including the header, chat area, and message input field.
- **CSS:** Styles the elements for an attractive UI.
- **JavaScript:** Handles message sending, auto-reply functionality, and redirection to another page based on a secret phrase.

### Secret Feature: Password Redirection

Discover the secret! When you type the word "password" into the message input field and hit "Send," the app will redirect you to a hidden web page—a text encryptor and decryptor.

### Usage

This code serves as an entertaining example of how to create a hidden feature within a web app using JavaScript. You can adapt and expand upon this concept to implement hidden functionalities in your own projects.

## Text Encryptor/Decryptor

### Description

The "Text Encryptor/Decryptor" is a web page that provides text encryption and decryption using XOR encryption and Base64 encoding. It includes JavaScript functions for encryption and decryption with a secret key.

### Code Structure

- **HTML:** Contains input fields for text, buttons to encrypt and decrypt text, and spaces to display the results.
- **JavaScript:** Defines encryption and decryption functions using XOR operations and Base64 encoding/decoding.
- **Event Listeners:** Used to trigger encryption, decryption, and copying text to the clipboard.

### Usage

This code serves as a simple web-based tool for text encryption and decryption. Modify the secret key and integrate it into your application where secure text handling is required.

## Note

Please remember that this is a playful example designed for educational purposes. When implementing security features in real applications, it's crucial to use strong security practices and encryption methods.
