GitHub README for Fake Messaging App with Secret "Password"

Introduction

This repository contains an HTML code example for a fake messaging app with a secret "password" feature. When you type the specific password, it will redirect you to a hidden web page—a text encryptor and decryptor. This fun example demonstrates a simple use case for creating a hidden feature within a web app.

Fake Messaging App

Description

The "Fake Messaging App" is a web page designed to mimic a messaging app's user interface. It includes a chat area, message input field, and JavaScript functionality to send and display messages. Additionally, there is a hidden secret feature accessible via a specific password.

Code Structure

- The HTML file defines the structure of the messaging app interface, including the header, chat area, and message input field.
- The CSS styles the elements for an attractive UI.
- The JavaScript code handles message sending, auto-reply functionality, and redirection to another page based on a secret phrase.

Secret Feature: Password Redirection

When you type the word "password" into the message input field and hit "Send," the app will redirect you to a hidden web page—a text encryptor and decryptor.

Usage

This code serves as an entertaining example of how to create a hidden feature within a web app using JavaScript. You can adapt and expand upon this concept to implement hidden functionalities in your own projects.

Text Encryptor/Decryptor

Description

The "Text Encryptor/Decryptor" is a web page that provides text encryption and decryption using XOR encryption and Base64 encoding. It includes JavaScript functions for encryption and decryption with a secret key.

Code Structure

- The HTML file contains input fields for text, buttons to encrypt and decrypt text, and spaces to display the results.
- The JavaScript code defines encryption and decryption functions using XOR operations and Base64 encoding/decoding.
- Event listeners are used to trigger encryption, decryption, and copying text to the clipboard.

Usage

This code serves as a simple web-based tool for text encryption and decryption. You can modify the secret key and integrate it into your application where secure text handling is required.

Note

Please keep in mind that this is a playful example designed for educational purposes. It's essential to use strong security practices and encryption methods when implementing security features in real applications.
